<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Thanks for visiting me at my website. Every time I work I have a great passion to do it. My years of experience are. 1. Video editor for 5 years with Adobe Premire. 2. Worked at a Bakery for a summer. 3. TKD for 4 years. 4. Did a summer camp on coding and still learning more now. The thing I want to do when I get older is be a director and writer.  </p>
